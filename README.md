## Hello!

I started programming with C,  now mainly use Python becuase I'm lazy /hj. and also trying to learn rust! (though I do occasionally use some other languages like ruby!)


**I apologise in advance for this massive wall of text 🫡**

I have a few projects, but you should check out these:

* [kindling](https://github.com/DaBlower/daydreamer) - This is one of my favourite projects!!! I made it along with [2 other people](https://github.com/DaBlower/daydreamer/graphs/contributors) for Daydream ([a game jam](https://daydream.hackclub.com/sydney)), which was just so so fun! Basically a platformer, with a unique mechanic, you have a light that surrounds you (like a candle), and it slowly runs out. You can exchange some light for things like flying in the shop, however the less light you have, the less you can see and if you run out, you lose (the theme was "sacrifices must be made").
* [chronotime](https://github.com/DaBlower/Hacker-Roadmap/settings) - One of my first games made in Godot for Hack Club's [Jumpstart](https://jumpstart.hackclub.com) -- though it's just a platformer with no extra features, which is quite boring tbh 😭
* [orpheusmarket](https://github.com/DaBlower/orpheusmarket) - A replica heidimarket site for Hack Club's Summer of Making!
* [my raycast extension](https://github.com/DaBlower/markdown-to-html-raycast) - A raycast extension that converts html to markdown and markdown to html!
* [duck](https://github.com/DaBlower/duck) - a Slack bot that does alot of random stuff for me! (kinda like Zeon but worse iykyk lol)
* [u-crawler](https://github.com/DaBlower/u-crawler) - A command line tool that scrapes the University of New South Wales courses page to get a list of all courses and their properties (such as units of credit) *while* respecting [robots.txt](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/)!

and some of these random projects that don't really serve an important purpose loll
* [euans-face-pics](https://github.com/DaBlower/euans-face-pics) - an api made with Flask (ik, it's very weird 😭) that serves images of the one and only Sir Euan (G)ripper The Third, feel free to contribute any that you have!
* [dumbahh-anc](https://github.com/DaBlower/dumbahh-anc) - this is 100% guaranteed to not work, however it's basically me trying to learn rust and make a project -- one that _should_ use a microphone for software anc, but will probably not work due to the extreme latency compared to hardware anc

and a lot more hardware projects!
* [tempBoard](https://github.com/DaBlower/tempBoard) - A PCB that shows temperature and relative humidity on a 128x64px OLED screen using a SHTC3 sensor
* [wasdpad](https://github.com/DaBlower/wasdpad) - A macropad with 6 inputs and 3 layers, an OLED display and neopixels! Made for Hackclub's [Hackpad YSWS](https://hackpad.hackclub.com) as a part of [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackclub.com)!
* [treeBoard (see a theme here?)](https://github.com/DaBlower/treeboard) - A PCB that has 3 switches and 3 LEDs, which you can play various minigames on with a Xiao RP2040 as the microcontroller
* [solder (one of my first actual hardware projects!!!)](https://github.com/DaBlower/solder) - A fun light-up-in-the-dark pcb shaped like a duck that can be used as a keytag for decoration
