## Hello!

I started programming with C,  mainly use Python becuase I'm lazy /hj. and now I'm learning rust! (though I do occasionally use some other languages like ruby!)



I have a few projects, but you should check out these:

* [orpheusmarket](https://github.com/DaBlower/orpheusmarket) - A replica heidimarket site for Hack Club's Summer of Making!
* [my raycast extension](https://github.com/DaBlower/markdown-to-html-raycast) - A raycast extension that converts html to markdown and markdown to html!
* [shells](https://github.com/DaBlower/shells) - (Work in progress!) A tool that predicts the amount of shells you will recieve from a ship in Summer of Making!
* [u-crawler](https://github.com/DaBlower/u-crawler) - A command line tool that scrapes the University of New South Wales courses page to get a list of all courses and their properties (such as units of credit) *while* respecting [robots.txt](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/)!

and a lot more hardware projects!
